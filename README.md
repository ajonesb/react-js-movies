# react-movie-app
With the simplicity of React js, I created this app to query the Movie DB Api and search for any movies on the api. The components are structured very easily with smaller, simple to read code as React elegantly does as well with jsx and ES6 Javascript to easily query the Movie db api with a simple ES6 javascript fetch.
